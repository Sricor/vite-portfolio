  <p>I had been given 2 tasks for the summer, first of which was working on the <a
      href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R7C92yimJxUmWWMgGORdC5PYRnePDaIw" target="_blank">Command Line
      feature</a> of the product which had been spec’d but was yet to be designed. The other task was making a
    style guide for the entire CAD design components as a first step towards building a robust design system.
  </p>
  <p>On the weekend before my internship ended, while working on the style guide I thought of making a small
    goodbye gift for the team and made them a CAD-style Atom editor theme called <a
      href="https://atom.io/themes/atom-mark43-ui">Atom Mark43 UI</a>.
    If you use Atom feel free to try the theme.</p>
